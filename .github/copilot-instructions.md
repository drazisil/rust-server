This is a Rust-based server project. It includes both TCP and HTTP capabilities. The HTTP server uses Actix-web for routing and logging, while the TCP server forwards HTTP requests to the HTTP server and handles custom binary protocols for non-HTTP requests. Please follow Rust's best practices and use industry-standard libraries like Serde for serialization.
